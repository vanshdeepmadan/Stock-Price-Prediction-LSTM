# Stock-Price-Prediction-LSTM
	•Developed a stock price prediction system using historical data to forecast future closing prices.
 
	•Implemented LSTM and Transformer models to capture sequential dependencies and compare performance.
 
	•Engineered features such as moving averages, volatility, and normalized the data using MinMaxScaler for model efficiency.
 
	•Created sliding window sequences to handle time-series data, enabling the models to learn patterns from stock trends.
 
	•Trained and evaluated the models on selected stocks (AAPL, TSLA, SPY, PFE, SHOP) and compared performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and MAE
 
	•Visualized actual vs predicted prices, where LSTM outperformed the Transformer for short-term patterns with lower MSE and RMSE.
